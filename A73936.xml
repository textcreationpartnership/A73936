            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Quenes Maieſtie callyng to her good remembraunce howe well thys Realme is furniſhed with good lawes and orders, for redreſſe of many enormities, and howe through negligence of officers, and preſumption of offendours, the ſame neuertheleſſe do rather growe then abate: hath thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght mete at this preſent to deuiſe with her counſel, howe ſome fewe neceſſary lawes very beneficial for this tyme, might be duely executed and obſerued, as they were meant, to the weale of the Realme, and comfort of her Maieſtie. For which purpoſe her Maieſtie geueth all maner her ſubiectes to vnderſtande, that lyke as the laſt yeare a certaine abbreuiat of Statutes was made and publiſhed by order of her Counſayle, vpon her commaundement, and was by the Iuſtices of peace in diuers countreys diligently regarded, and in a great part put towards executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though in ſome other partes for lacke of time, the ſame toke not ſo good effect. So her Maieſtie chargeth all maner her Iuſtices and other miniſters to whom the ſame ſhal belong, to take in hand agayne theyr former charge geuen to them the laſt yeare, for thexecution of the ſayd Statutes, haſtening theyr aſſembles for that purpoſe, now in the beginning of thys Sommer, ſo as theyr doynges may be certified in ſuch ſort as they were commaunded and preſcribed the laſt yeare.</p>
            <p>And beſydes theſe, her Maieſtie fyndeth lyke cauſe to haue two other great enormities dayly increaſing in this her Realme to be ſpedely refourmed, for which there do remaine in force good lawes. The one is, the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous abuſe of Apparell almoſt in all eſtates, but principally in the meaner ſorte. The other is the decaye and diſfurniture of all kynde of Horſes for ſeruice within the Realme. And becauſe her Maieſtie perceaueth, that although the lawes be very penal in both theſe caſes, yet withoute ſome ſpeciall directyon geuen for thexecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, the reformation wyll not enſue: Her Maieſtie hath cauſed the ſtatutes remaynyng in force for both the ſayde purpoſes, to be briefly collected, and preſently by this her Proclamation chargeth all maner her She ryffes to publyſhe the ſame ioyntly with this Proclamation, and to fyx the ſame vp in places accuſtomed.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Apparell.</note>And for the maner of the ſpedy execution of the Statutes for Apparell &amp; other enormities incident therto: Her maieſtie hath cauſed certaine good ordinaunces to be deuiſed, and accorded by her counſel, which alſo her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties pleaſure is to be well regarded, ſtraightly kept and obſerued according to the ſeueral limitations therof: Wherfore there is good hope conceaued by her Maieſtie of a ſpedye redreſſe by meanes of the ſaid good orders. And yf in any poynt of the ſame ſtatutes or orders, any doubt ſhal aryſe for the vnderſtanding of the ſame: her Maieſtie wylleth that the aduyſe and aunſwere of her priuie counſel be required and folowed. And for the other defaulte tending to the decaye of horſes within the Realme, which partly ryſeth by ſtealing and carrying num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Horſes, Geldynges, Mares, and Coltes out of the Realme, and by neglectyng the breeding and keping of Horſes within the Realme, accordyng to the lawes prouyded.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Carriyng of Horſes out of the Realme.</note>For redreſſe of the former part concernyng carrying out of Horſes out of the Realme: her Maieſtie chargeth al maner her ſubiectes, and others within her Realme, to take knowledge of the lawes nowe publyſhed for that purpoſe, and not to truſt in any remiſſion of penalties therfore prouyded. For the ſpedier obſeruation wherof her Maieſtie meaneth ſhortly to directe her ſeuerall Commiſſions vnder the great Seale, to ſuch parts of her Realme where the conueyaunce hath accuſtomably bene, or hereafter may be, to enquire therof diligently and ſtreyghtly by order of law, and therevpon to procede ſharpely to thexecution, as the caſes ſhall requyre.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Breeding and ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng of Horſes.</note>And as to the latter parte tendyng to the decaye of breading &amp; keping of Horſes: her Maieſtie doth lykewiſe charge all maner her ſubiectes to take knowledge of the lawes remayning in force, and now publiſhed at thys preſent tyme. And for that it is thought by her Maieſtie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſame lawes hath ben by diuers perſons ſo long
<pb facs="tcp:173523:2" rendition="simple:additions"/> forgotten, that it wyll ſeme harde to haue the ſame ſpedely put in execution: her Maieſtie of her gracious diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, meaneth to proceade to thexecution therof in this maner folowyng.</p>
            <p>Her Maieſtie intendeth to direct her ſeuerall Commiſſions to ſpecial perſons in euery countie of the Realme, to enquire by order of lawe, what perſons ſhall not haue before the .xv. of Auguſt next, Horſes accordyng to the Statute by reaſon of theyr wyues apparell mentioned in the Statute, and what other perſons chargeable to breedyng or kepyng of Horſes by force of the Statutes, ſhall not before the .xv. of December nexte, perfourme the meanyng and intent of the ſayde Statutes, aſwell for breedyng as kepyng. And for the more certayne exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution hereof: her Maieſtie alſo meaneth to cauſe a ſpeciall vieu to be taken through the Realme in September next, of the numbre inquirable by the foreſayde .xv. daye of Auguſte, as is aboue expreſſed: and a lyke muſter and vieu to be taken in Ianuarye nexte at one inſtaunt tyme, both of the ſame numbre, and of all the reſt wherof inquiſition ſhalbe made by the ſayde Commiſſion, to be prouyded before the ſayde .xv. day of December.</p>
            <p>After which views and muſters taken: her Maieſtie intendeth at euery halfe yere to haue the ſame ſeuerely exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by officers ſpecially appoynted, vntyll the Realme be replenyſhed with ſuch number of Horſes, as may be well kept and mayntayned for the ſeruice of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Of all theſe her Maieſties determinations, tendyng only to the weale, good order, and ſtrength of her Realme: her Maieſtie hath thought mete in this playne maner to geue notyce therof by this Proclamation to all maner her ſubiectes, to auoyde the paynes that otherwyſe therof muſt and ſhall enſue.</p>
